      When playing audio through WebAudio, we want to be able to measure the delay of that audio and the glitchiness of
      the audio. This document contains a proposal of an API that would allow WebAudio users to do this.
    </p>

      This is an unofficial proposal.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches (gaps in the played audio, which
      typically happens due to underperformance in the audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the
      instantaneous playout latency using <a
        href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#dom-audiocontext-outputlatency">AudioContext.outputLatency</a>,
      but no simple way to measure
      average/minimum/maximum latency over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glitches and high latency are bad for the user experience, so if any of these occur it can be useful for the
      application to be able to detect this and possibly take some action to improve the playout.

        <p>
          The {{AudioContext/AudioPlayoutStats}} under AudioContext is a dedicated object for statistics reporting:
          Similar to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/#dom-rtcaudioplayoutstats">RTCAudioPlayoutStats</a>
           but it is for the playout path via AudioDestinationNode and the associated output device.
          This will allow us to measure glitches occurring due to underperforming AudioWorklets as well as glitches and
          delay occurring in the playout path between the AudioContext and the output device.</p>

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>fallbackFramesDuration</dfn> attribute</h2>
        <p>This value is measured in milliseconds and is incremented
          each time a fallback frame is played by the output device at the end of the playout path. This metric can be
          used together with {{AudioPlayoutStats/totalFramesDuration}} to calculate the percentage of played out media
          that was not provided by the AudioContext.

      </section>
      <section>
        <h2><dfn>fallbackFramesEvents</dfn> attribute</h2>
        <p>This measures the number of synthesized fallback frames events.
          This counter increases every time a fallback frame is played after a non-fallback frame. That is, multiple
          consecutive fallback frames will increase {{AudioPlayoutStats/fallbackFramesDuration}} multiple times but is a
          single fallback
          frames event.

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>totalFramesDuration</dfn> attribute</h2>
        <p>This attribute is the total duration, in milliseconds, of all audio
          frames that have been played by the audio device. Includes both fallback and non-fallback frames.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2><dfn>averageLatency</dfn> attribute</h2>
        <p>This is the average latency for the frames played since the
          last call to {{AudioPlayoutStats/resetLatency()}}, or since the creation of the AudioContext if
          {{AudioPlayoutStats/resetLatency()}} has
          not been called.</p>

          {{AudioPlayoutStats/resetLatency()}} has not been called. </p>

      <section>
        <h2><dfn>resetLatency</dfn> method</h2>
        <p>This method resets the latency counters. Note that it does not remove

  <section id="usage">
    <h2>Usage Example</h2>
    This is an example of how the API can be used to calculate the following stats over a time interval:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fraction of fallback frames
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequency of fallback frames events (glitches)
      </li>
      <li>
        Average playout delay
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <pre class="js">
var oldTotalFramesDuration = audioContext.playoutStats.totalFramesDuration;
var oldFallbackFramesDuration = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesDuration;
var oldFallbackFramesEvents = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesEvents;
audioContext.playoutStats.resetLatency();

// Wait while playing audio
...

// the number of seconds that were covered by the frames played by the output device between the two executions.
let deltaTotalFramesDuration = (audioContext.playoutStats.totalFramesDuration - oldTotalFramesDuration) / 1000;
let deltaFallbackFramesDuration = (audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesDuration - oldFallbackFramesDuration) / 1000;
let deltaFallbackFramesEvents = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesEvents - oldFallbackFramesEvents;

// fallback frames fraction stat over the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let fallbackFramesFraction = deltaFallbackFramesDuration / deltaTotalFramesDuration;
// fallback event frequency stat over the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let fallbackEventFrequency = deltaFallbackFramesEvents / deltaTotalFramesDuration;
// Average playout delay stat during the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let playoutDelay = audioContext.playoutStats.averageLatency / 1000;
