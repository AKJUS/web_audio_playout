      When playing audio through WebAudio, we want to be able to measure the delay of that audio and the glitchiness of
      the audio. This document contains a proposal of an API that would allow WebAudio users to do this.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="sotd">
    <p>
      This is an unofficial proposal.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      There is currently no way to detect whether WebAudio playout has glitches (gaps in the played audio, which
      typically happens due to underperformance in the audio pipeline). There is an existing way to measure the
      instantaneous playout latency using <a
        href="https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#dom-audiocontext-outputlatency">AudioContext.outputLatency</a>,
      but no simple way to measure
      average/minimum/maximum latency over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glitches and high latency are bad for the user experience, so if any of these occur it can be useful for the
      application to be able to detect this and possibly take some action to improve the playout.
    </p>
    <p>

          The {{AudioContext/AudioPlayoutStats}} under {{AudioContext}} is a dedicated object for statistics reporting;
          Similar to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webrtc-stats/#dom-rtcaudioplayoutstats">RTCAudioPlayoutStats</a>,
           but it is for the playout path via {{AudioDestinationNode}} and the associated output device.
          This will allow us to measure glitches occurring due to underperforming {{AudioWorklet}}s as well as glitches and
          delay occurring in the playout path between the {{AudioContext}} and the output device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audio glitches are expressed in terms of fallback frames and fallback events.
      <ul>
      <li>A <dfn>fallback frame</dfn> is an audio frame played by the output device that was not provided
by the playout path. This happens when the playout path fails to provide audio frames
to the output device on time, in which case fallback frames will be played (fallback frames are typically silence). This typically
only happens if the pipeline is underperforming. This includes underrun situations that happen for reasons unrelated to WebAudio/{{AudioWorklet}}s.</li>
    
  <li>A <dfn>fallback event</dfn> is a continuous interval of fallback frames being played. When a fallback frame is played after a non-fallback frame, we consider this a fallback event.</li>
  </ul>

  <section id="usage">
    <h2>Usage Example</h2>
    This is an example of how the API can be used to calculate the following stats over a time interval:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fraction of fallback frames
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequency of fallback frames events (glitches)
      </li>
      <li>
        Average playout delay
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <pre class="js">
var oldTotalFramesDuration = audioContext.playoutStats.totalFramesDuration;
var oldFallbackFramesDuration = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesDuration;
var oldFallbackFramesEvents = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesEvents;
audioContext.playoutStats.resetLatency();

// Wait while playing audio
...

// the number of seconds that were covered by the frames played by the output device between the two executions.
let deltaTotalFramesDuration = (audioContext.playoutStats.totalFramesDuration - oldTotalFramesDuration) / 1000;
let deltaFallbackFramesDuration = (audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesDuration - oldFallbackFramesDuration) / 1000;
let deltaFallbackFramesEvents = audioContext.playoutStats.fallbackFramesEvents - oldFallbackFramesEvents;

// fallback frames fraction stat over the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let fallbackFramesFraction = deltaFallbackFramesDuration / deltaTotalFramesDuration;
// fallback event frequency stat over the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let fallbackEventFrequency = deltaFallbackFramesEvents / deltaTotalFramesDuration;
// Average playout delay stat during the last deltaTotalFramesDuration seconds
let playoutDelay = audioContext.playoutStats.averageLatency / 1000;

    <h2>Security & Privacy considerations</h2>
    <h3>Covert channel</h3>
    <p>
      See <a
      href="https://github.com/WICG/web_audio_playout/issues/4">discussion with Privacy WG</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The glitch information provided by the API could be used to form a cross-site covert channel between two cooperating webstites. One site could transmit information by intentionally causing audio glitches (by causing very high CPU usage, for example) while the other site could use the API to detect these glitches.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mitigations">Mitigations</h3>
    <p>To inihibit the usage of this covert channel, implementers should apply these mitigations.</p>
    <h4>Rate-limiting</h4>
    <p>
      Implementers should not update the values returned by the API more often than once per second. This limits the bandwidth of the covert channel.
    </p>
    <h4>Restricting API access</h4>
    <p>
      Implementers should only provide access to the API to sites that fulfill <i>at least one</i> of the following criteria:
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>The site has obtained <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia</a> permission.</b>
          <p>The reasoning is that if a site has obtained <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia</a> permission, it can receive glitch information more efficiently through use of the microphone. These methods include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                One site can transmit a message by playing ultrasound (inaudible to humans) through the speaker, and the site with the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia</a> permission can listen to it through the microphone.
              </li>
              <li>
                The site can play a sine-wave at a frequency inaudible to humans, and listen to it through the microphone. By checking for gaps in the recorded signal, glitches can be detected much more reliably than what is possible using the API.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Therefore, restricting the use of the API is no longer useful for mitigating the covert channel.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The site is active/visible.</b>
          <p>Assuming that neither cooperating site has microphone permission, this criteria ensures that the site that receives the covert signal must be visible, restricting the conditions under which the covert channel can be used. It makes it impossible for sites to communicate with each other using the covert channel while not visible.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Future mitigations</h4>
    If microphone access becomes more secure in the future, the reasoning for allowing API access to sites with <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia">getUserMedia</a> permission may no longer apply. If this happens, the API access requirements should be reevaluated.
